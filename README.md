# blockchain

General purpose blockchain with dynamic proof of work, implemented in Clojure/lisp

## Usage
```lein deps```

Open up your favorite repl
```lein repl```

Start mining:
```(generate-next-block! "My data" @block-chain)```

Difficulty should dynamically change if you include more miners. This can be achieved by instantiating a few go-loops.
